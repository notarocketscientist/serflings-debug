# Can not demolish building

In these savegames, I am not able to demolish a specific guard house near a garrison/castle.

Open savegame `SAVE8.DE` (name `21.6-BUG-DEL` and game time `05h 05m 50s`) and press `PAUSE`. Then try to demlish the guard house at the location `9784 (1230) (14/19)` near the western border.

There is currently another guard house burning which I demolished seconds before, a bit northerly at `7732 (973) (13/15)`. (My plan was to "restructure" my line of defence at the frontier). As long as this guard house is burning, I can not demolish the first one, which mentioned at the beginning.

After the northern guard house has finished burning and has been removed from the map, I am able to demolish the other one.

That seems odd/wrong, because normally, you are able to demolish anything you like simultaneously (as long the building is not currently under attack).

## My environment

* Win 10, 64
* Serflings 2.0.0 (with integrated JRE)
* Map: `PASTURE` (campaign mission #21)
* Original game file: `SPAE.PA`

## Thanks

Thank you, `nicymike`, for the awesome "Serfings Remake Project". I hope this can help finding / resolving bugs and make it an even better game.
