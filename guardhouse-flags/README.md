# Guardhouse flags

In these savegames, the flags of the guardhouses (towers etc) are "strange".

There is only the AI castle left and everything else (around it) is owned by the (human) player.

I expect the guardhouse occupation to be a circle around the enemy's castle ranging from full (closest) to medium and finally to minimum occupation (farthest to the border).

These occupations are indicated by the flag type at the guardhouse (tower etc). All flags have a white background and a...

* thick black cross: closest to the border
* thin black cross: somewhat close to the border
* thin black line: far a away from the border.
* The white flag without anything means, that the border is really far away

However, in this savegame, there are "thick black crosses" at the border and then, one circle of guardhouses later, there are only white flags following. No thin black crosses or thin black line flags in between.

On serveral positions there are some guardhouse with a thin black line, which doesn't make sense (?):

* 17128 (58/33) - Building 66
* 13492 (45/26) - Building 27
* 11940 (41/23) - Building 184

## Disclaimer

I don't know if this is specific for this match/map, but I havent realized this before.

## My environment

* Win 10, 64
* Serflings 1.2.2 and 2.0.0 (with integrated JRE)
* Map: PIECE (campaign mission #15)

## Thanks

Thank you, `nicymike`, for the awesome "Serfings Remake Project". I hope this can help finding / resolving bugs and make it an even better game.
