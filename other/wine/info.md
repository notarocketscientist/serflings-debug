# Run Serflings with Wine (Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS)

Install Wine - currently version 5.0-3ubuntu1 from 2020 (?):

```
sudo apt install wine
```

Download latest stable version (2.0 - with bundled JRE) and run the game:

```
cd <game dir>
wine serflings.exe
```

## Testing

So far, this has been testet/noticed:

* game launches
* right-click scrolling is a bit to fast (maybe a Wine setting?)
